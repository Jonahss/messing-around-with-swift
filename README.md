Just some small programs for practicing Swift and learning about some algorithms.

The `.swift` files are standalone, but run `npm install` in a folder in order to bring in `gulp.js`. Running `gulp` from the commandline will compile and run the Swift code. `gulp watch` will continuously watch `.swift` files for changes and rerun on every save.
